"""Compatibility shim for the cuik_molmaker feature-name API rename.

cuik_molmaker renamed the `*_feature_names_to_array` family to
`*_feature_names_to_tensor` after 0.2. The kermt:latest docker image ships
the newer name; the host conda env (admet_dev_py311) still pins 0.2 with
the older name. The downstream consumers (`mol_featurizer`,
`batch_mol_featurizer`) accept whichever container type the matching
helper returns, so the call sites only care about which symbol exists.

Import the three names from here instead of from cuik_molmaker directly:

    from chemflow.deep_learning.kermt.vendor.kermt.util._cuik_compat import (
        atom_onehot_feature_names_to_tensor,
        atom_float_feature_names_to_tensor,
        bond_feature_names_to_tensor,
    )

Each resolves at module-load time and raises AttributeError with a clear
message if neither variant is present.
