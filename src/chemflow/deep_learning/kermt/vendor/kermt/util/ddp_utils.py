Shared DistributedDataParallel (DDP) helpers for KERMT.

Used by the pretraining and finetuning DDP launchers so both share a single,
proven single-node DDP bootstrap. The logic here matches what pretraining has
used in production (localhost rendezvous, NCCL backend, per-process GPU pinning
by rank, and topology-aware NCCL P2P configuration).
